					<p><strong>The National Basketball Association</strong> (NBA) is an American men's professional basketball league.It is composed of 
					30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada) and is one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada.
					It is widely considered to be the premier men's professional basketball league in the world.<br><br>

					The league was founded in <em>New York City</em> on June 6, 1946, as the<strong> Basketball Association of America</strong> (BAA).It changed its name to the 
					<strong>National Basketball Association </strong>on August 3, 1949, after merging with the competing <strong>National Basketball League</strong> (NBL).
					The NBA's regular  season runs from October to April, with each team playing 82 games. The league's playoff tournament extends into June. As of 2020, 
					NBA players are the world's best paid athletes by average annual salary per player.<br><br>
	
	
					The <strong>Basketball Association of America</strong> was founded in 1946 by owners of the major ice hockey arenas in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States and Canada. 
					On November 1, 1946, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens, in a game the NBA now refers to 
					as the first game played in NBA history. The first basket was made by Ossie Schectman of the Knickerbockers. Although there had been earlier attempts at professional 
					basketball leagues, including the American Basketball League and the NBL, the BAA was the first league to attempt to play primarily in large arenas in major cities. During its early years, 
					the quality of play in the BAA was not significantly better than in competing leagues or among leading independent clubs such as the Harlem Globetrotters. For instance, the 1948 
					ABL finalist Baltimore Bullets moved to the BAA and won that league's 1948 title, and the 1948 NBL champion Minneapolis Lakers won the 1949 BAA title. Prior to the 1948‚Äì49 season,
					however, NBL teams from Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and Rochester jumped to the BAA, which established the BAA as the league of choice for collegians looking to turn 
					professional.</p><a name = "middle">

						<p>The NBA is a 70-year-old organization born from innovation. 
							It was June 1946 in New York City when Boston Garden owner Walter Brown 
							realized that major ice hockey arenas, which were vacant most nights, 
							could be used to host basketball games. He established the Basketball Association 
							of America, which in 1949 merged with the National Basketball League to create the 
							National Basketball Association. <br><br>The NBA has a rich tradition of game-changing 
							plays and storied rivalries, personal sagas and team dynasties. Players and fans
							 alike share the excitement of reliving key moments in basketball history, and 
							 admiring the excellence of former players, coaches and teams who helped shape 
							 the game. The league is home to living legends, and we honor their achievements
							  while also looking to the future.<br><br>Today, the NBA is the most innovative 
							  league in sports, helping drive the growth of the game around the globe.
							   We‚Äôre pioneers in using technology to deliver content to fans over all forms
								of media, and a leader in social responsibility and community development.<br><br>
								We‚Äôre preparing the league‚Äôs rising stars and staff in the NBA G League, 
								our official minor league. Further, we‚Äôre growing and expanding our Jr. 
								NBA programs to get kids playing basketball and to nurture a love of the game 
								and its values. Through our NBA Cares program, we‚Äôre building places where families
								can live, learn and play.</p>
